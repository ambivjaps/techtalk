			<p> TechTalk Philippines Inc. is a website dedicated to tech reviews and all things related to technology. Ranging from cellphones to video game consoles to personal computers, TechTalk aims to guide tech enthusiasts on what product best suits their needs based on tech reviews made by other users. We encourage users to share their candid and honest thoughts about a certain product. Their opinions/thoughts may vary, but this helps in creating a balanced review environment.
			<br><br>
			Established in October 2021, we have gained a small but loyal following. What started off as a dream by three tech enthusiasts has grown into a website that is currently being used by different users from around the globe. Truly, TechTalk is a website that is made <strong> by tech enthusiasts for the tech enthusiasts. </strong>
			<br><br>
			Slowly and surely, we aim to establish our website as the "go-to-site" not only for tech enthusiasts, but also for people that are not too knowledgeable yet about the world of technology.</p>
